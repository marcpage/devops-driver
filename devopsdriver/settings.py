""" Settings that can be in files, environment, or on the command line 

    Settings can be set on the command line, environment, in the code, or in files.
    
    Priority order:
    - in code
    - command line
    - environment
    - files
    
    Files can be JSON or YAML.
    They must have .json, .yml, or .yaml extension.
    Files can be named after the file passed in (__file__) or "devopsdriver".
    All files named after the file passed in have priority over "devopsdriver".
    This allows for shared settings for multiple scripts as well as specific settings.
    Files can be in an OS-specific preferences location, a series of specified directories, 
        or next to the file passed in (__file__).
    This allows for secrets, keys, and tokens to be stored on the machine and not in the repo.
    
    Files in the OS specific directories have priority over other files and are stored in:
    - macOS: ~/Library/Preferences/
    - Windows: %APPDATA%/
    - Linux: ~/.devopsdriver/
    
    You can have environment variable substitutions in the values in the files.
    For instance, you can specify:
    
    output: ${home}/reports
    
    The `${home}` will be replaced with the value of the HOME environment variable, if it exists.
    If the environment variable does not exist, no change is made.
    
    Use case 1: Secrets not in repo
        tokens, passwords, etc can be stored in <pref>/devopsdriver.yml
        This will allow for all scripts to access those secrets
            but they are not in the repo.
        For pipeline runs these secrets can be passed on the command line or in the environment.
    
    Use case 2: common settings among scripts
        Store your common settings in devopsdriver.yml next to your script.
        All scripts in this directory will have access to these settings.
        For instance, say you want all emails sent from the same person.
        You could set 'email: me@domain.com' in devopsdriver.html.
        You could also, store report paths, emails, groups, holidays, etc.
        Any data all scripts may want to have access to.
        
    Use case 3: configurable settings
        Any settings in your script that you may want to configure.
        If your script is `cool_script.py` then put the settings in `cool_script.yml` next to it.
        This could be colors, emails, repos, queries, whatever.
    
    Use case 4: override secrets for specific script
        Overriding secrets stored in `<pref>/devopsdriver.yml` for specific scripts.
        If your script is `cool_script.py` save them to `<pref>/cool_script.yml`.
    
    *Note*: You can override a specific setting in a sub-dictionary.
    For instance, say `<pref>/devopsdriver.yml`:
    
    ```yaml
    api:
        user: johndoe
        password: Setec Astronomy
    ```
    
    You could override this for `cool_script.py` be adding `<pref>/cool_script.yml`:
    
    ```yaml
    api:
        user: janedoe
    ```
    
    johndoe and janedoe share the same password, so you just need to update the `user`
